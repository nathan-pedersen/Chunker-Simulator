> **OSRS Chunk Picker** is a procedural generation simulation tool designed for Old School RuneScape gameplay challenges (such as chunk-locked accounts). It overlays an interactive grid onto the high-resolution world map, allowing players to simulate the "discovery" of the world through RNG rolls.
> **Key Features:**
> * **Interactive Map:** High-performance viewport rendering engine with smooth pan and zoom (up to 300x).
> * **Fog of War:** Start in pitch black and visually unlock chunks as you progress.
> * **Fate Rolling:** Randomly selects adjacent "Rollable" chunks or Transport destinations to expand your territory.
> * **Statistical Simulation:** Built-in Monte Carlo simulations (1,000+ runs) to calculate the average number of rolls required to reach specific targets or clear map sections.
> * **State Management:** Track Targets, Transport links, and Unlocked areas with full Save/Load functionality.
